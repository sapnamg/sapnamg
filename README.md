# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sapna!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
Iâ€™m currently an audiologist, passionate about helping people communicate and connect. My day-to-day work involves problem solving, attention to detail, and finding creative solutions for my patients. These are skills that I enjoy applying to my journey in software development. I love learning new things, and am interested in how technology can improve lives and solve real-world problems.

I'm still learning and exploring new technologies, and I love tackling challenges both in healthcare and code. Here you'll find some of my projects, all of which will continue to be updated and improved as I learn more.
